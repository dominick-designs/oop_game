# Phraser Game Show App

[See live version of the game](https://object-oriented-vanilla-js.dominickdesigns.space/)

This is a pure vanilla javascript app. It is a "phrase-hunter" app wherein the user is provided with an onscreen keyboard and a hidden phrase. The game outline is as follows:

1) guess the word by choosing letters
2) limited number of guesses 
3) lose a heart if incorrect guess
4) win game if correct phrase is chosen with hearts remaining
5) lose game if all hearts are lost

## Technologies used
* Object Oriented Vanilla JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Known Issues
1) key stroke is not disabled after one keyup (this only happens with 'wrong' keys; meanwhile, keys are disabled for 'chosen' keys)
2) when clicking 'start' button after game is lost or won, game is not completely reset.

## Roadmap

1) could add timer that starts on page load to increase intensity
