# Phraser Game Show App

This is a pure vanilla javascript app. It is a "phrase-hunter" app wherein the user is provided with an onscreen keyboard and a hidden phrase. The game outline is as follows:

1) guess the word by choosing letters
2) limited number of guesses 
3) lose a heart if incorrect guess
4) win game if correct phrase is chosen with hearts remaining
5) lose game if all hearts are lost

## Known Issues
1) key stroke is not disabled after one keyup (this only happens with 'wrong' keys; meanwhile, keys are disabled for 'chosen' keys)
2) when clicking 'start' button after game is lost or won, game is not completely reset.

## Roadmap

1) could add timer that starts on page load to increase intensity
 
 #### Transparency 
 
 This app is part of the Treehouse Fullstack Javascript techdegree course. The HTML, CSS and images files were provided. A PDF guide was provided with a detailed outline on the classes and methods that were needed in order to get the app to work. Otherwise, all of the code in the ```js``` directory is original (except where noted as modified from elsewhere).
